This repository contains the .RData used for the final manuscript, along with R scripts containing:

- knowles-et-al_2021_jslhr_intelligibility_postprint_2021-05-17.pdf: postprint copy of Knowles et al., 2021
- .RData containing R data used in final manuscript
- R/radi_intell_models_revised.R: R script containing code used for the statistical models
- R/radi_intell_manuscript.R: R script code from the original manusciprt .Rmd file (extracted using `knitr::purl()`)

Note that the R scripts will not run on their own, as they rely on additional helper scripts that are a part of the larger RADI project. They are uploaded for transparency. The output of these scripts, however, is captured in the .RData file.
