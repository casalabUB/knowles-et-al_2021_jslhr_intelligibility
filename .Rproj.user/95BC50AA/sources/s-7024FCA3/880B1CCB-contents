# Introduction 

Improving speech intelligibility, i.e., the degree to which a spoken utterance is understood by a typical listener [@yorkston1996; @miller2013; @weismer2008], is one of the primary goals of behavioral speech intervention for individuals with Parkinson's disease and dysarthria [PD; @duffy2019]. The majority of people with PD will develop dysarthria at some point during the disease [@logemann1978; @mutch1986; @muller2001].
Standard pharmaceutical interventions (i.e., levodopa) tend to exhibit little to no effect on speech [@spencer2009; c.f. @cushnie2018; @im2018], and the increasingly common adjunctive surgical deep brain stimulation (DBS) is associated with further speech impairment in many individuals [@aldridge2016].
For many individuals, global speech treatments, rather than system-specific treatments, are desirable to effect change at a broad level. Global speech targets, such as rate, loudness, prosody, or clarity, aim to affect multiple speech subsystems [@yorkston2007].

One such global treatment strategy is speech rate reduction, which has been used to improve intelligibility across multiple types of dysarthria, including hypokinetic dysarthria. The goal of rate reduction is for the individual to learn to achieve a slower rate of speech more conducive to being understood when speaking [@duffy2013; @yorkston2007; @yorkston1990].
Speech rate is an appealing treatment variable because it is highly modifiable [@blanchet2009; @yorkston1992], and rate reduction has successfully been demonstrated to improve speech intelligibility across multiple motor speech disorders [@yorkston2007], including in PD [@downie1981; @hanson1983; @yorkston1990; @ledorze1992; @hammen1994; @adams1994; @martens2015]. However, the efficacy of rate reduction in improving intelligibility in talkers with PD is not straightforward. Despite promising findings in earlier case and small group studies, several recent studies have demonstrated that many talkers with dysarthria do not exhibit improved intelligibility when they reduce their speech rates, and some may even worsen [@vannuffelen2009; @vannuffelen2010; @hall2013; @kuo2014; @mcauliffe2017; @fletcher2017predicting]. 

It should be noted that goal of rate reduction interventions is not necessarily a *normal rate* but rather *improved intelligibility*. Some individuals with PD demonstrate faster rates of speech [@dab1969differential], and it may be the case that such individuals may approach a more "normal" rate as a consequence of rate reduction. Individuals with PD may also demonstrate greater speech rate acceleration (i.e., progressively speeding up) compared to controls [@skodda2008]. Generally speaking, however, reports of speech rate in people with PD are inconsistent and include findings of faster and slower rates, as well as no measurable differences compared to healthy talkers [@flint1992; @ludlow1987; @metter1986; @caligiuri1989; @skodda2008; @skodda2011rate]. 
There is likely a trade-off that will be exhibited, such that speech that is *too* slow may actually lead to worse intelligibility and/or reduced speech naturalness [@yorkston1999]. Though a less commonly reported therapeutic goal, a *faster* rate of speech may also be suggested for some individuals with dysarthria [@dagenais2006]. Considerably less literature has explored *faster* speech in talkers with PD [@mcrae2002; @kuo2014] or other types of dysarthria [@turner1995; @dinnocenzo2006], given that faster speech is rarely an appropriate therapeutic goal for these individuals.
The factors underlying changes in intelligibility as speech rate is adjusted by talkers with PD are still largely unknown.

The majority of studies that have explored intelligibility as a function of rate modification have done so by eliciting only one or two different rates (e.g., a "slow" and/or "fast" rate). The extent to which a speaker slows down (or speeds up) likely has a bearing on the extent to which intelligibility changes are noted. 
Two studies to date have demonstrated that slowing rates to 60\% of speaker's habitual rate led to substantial improvements in sentence intelligibility in speakers with hypokinetic dysarthria compared to slowing rates only to 80\% of their habitual rate [@yorkston1990; @hammen1994].

In their review of different rate control methods, @vannuffelen2009 explored three rates of speech elicited via delayed auditory feedback (DAF). The authors found that slower rates of speech elicited tended to be associated with *lower* intelligibility ratings.
Their follow-up study further found that maximal rate reduction across different rate control methods was not necessarily associated with maximal intelligibility gains [@vannuffelen2010].

@yorkston1999 described the likelihood of a trade-off between speech accuracy and speech naturalness such that, for a given speaker with dysarthria, the there may exist an intelligibility peak. Speaking *too* slowly in relation to this hypothetical peak would result in poorer understanding because of compromised speech naturalness, whereas speaking too quickly would lead to imprecise articulation. @yorkston1999 asserted that the goal of speech rate modification intervention is to identify a target rate that "will allow an optimal level of intelligibility without degrading naturalness unnecessarily" (pp. 416).

Studies of speech rate modification in PD have exclusively elicited speech via read passages and have largely ignored spontaneous speech samples. Evidence suggests that structured speech tasks, such as reading, tend to be more intelligible than spontaneous speech in PD [@yorkston1981; @weismer1984; @kempler2002; @kent1996; c.f. @bunton2008; @tjaden2011intelligibility]. Extemporaneous speech production is more ecologically valid, but is difficult to administer and control for across speakers. Given that the goal of behavioral speech therapy, regardless of the method employed, is to improve communication in the context of daily life, there is a need to better understand the impact of rate modification on more extemporaneous speech in spite of the challenges.

Studies of rate manipulation that encapsulate a wider continuum of speech rates and speech tasks have the power to inform researchers on 1) the extent to which modifying rate impacts the intelligibility of an utterance, 2) the kinds of changes that occur when speech rate is increased or decreased, and 3) how variations in these changes affect speaker groups and across individual speakers.
Given the variability and occasional improvements in speech outcomes associated with faster speech, this too merits further investigation for this population.
Determining the precise changes that occur for these speakers across a range speech tasks and speech rates will permit researchers to better understand the specific differences that lead to optimal speech intelligibility and how these targets are achieved.

<!-- Given the variability of dysarthria presentations, speech intelligibility and acoustic characteristics, and individual responses to speaking rate manipulations, this is a necessary addition to the literature.  -->
<!-- Taxing the system by requiring individuals to make multiple rate adjustments across a variety of speaking tasks will facilitate our understanding of how rate manipulations lead to changes in speech production and resulting intelligibility. Such an approach would allow the exploration of rate-precision and intelligibility trade-offs, and how these trade-offs differ across individuals. -->

<!-- Exploration of these relationships relies on the measurement of a large set of speech features. Despite decades of work, there is little consensus on the precise underlying articulatory and acoustic explanations for reduced intelligibility. Speech measurements that captures an array of articulatory movements and patterns across vowel and consonant production are necessary to describe the nature of deterioration or improvement in intelligibility. Such findings can offer greater explanations of the underlying nature of dysarthria types as well as individual subtypes, and thus can serve to inform candidacy selection for speech interventions targeting these individualized deficits. It is possible that individuals experience maximum intelligibility gains at different rates. A speech rate continuum would allow allow researchers and clinicians to better understand when and how this maximum occurs for different speakers. -->



## Rationale for the current study

The purpose of the current study is to identify changes in acoustic speech intelligibility in PD across a broad continuum of speech rate alterations in 1) read sentences and 2) extemporaneous speech (monologues).

### Primary Research Questions

Three primary gaps remain in the literature on speech rate and intelligibility in the speech of people with PD that this paper aims to address:

1. How does speech intelligibility change along a continuum of speech rates from very slow to very fast?
2. What differences emerge in talkers with PD and DBS compared to those with PD receiving standard pharmaceutical intervention?
3. How is intelligibility across such a rate continuum affected across read sentences and spontaneous monologues?

<!-- In healthy talkers, it is not the case that people that have naturally slower habitual speech are necessarily more intelligible [@cox1987; @bradlow1996]. -->
Relatedly, while faster speech has received less focus in the literature, at least one study has demonstrated that faster-than-normal speech is not necessarily associated with reduced intelligibility in talkers with PD [@kuo2014], and it may even be associated with increased naturalness or acceptability in some cases [@dagenais2006; @logan2002; @sussman2012].



# Methods

## Speech production experiment
### Speaker participants

Four participant groups were included in the final study for a grand total of 51 speakers: 1) younger healthy controls (YC: n = 17, under 35 years of age; 9 male), 2) older healthy control participants (OC; n = 17, 56 - 82 years of age; 11 male), 3) people with PD and dysarthria who were receiving standard pharmaceutical interventions (PD-Med; n = 22, 18 male), and 4) people with PD who had undergone STN-DBS surgery (PD-DBS; n = 12, 11 male). PD-DBS participants were also taking titrated doses of anti-parkinsonian medication.
Participant information for the PD groups are reported in `r tbls("demographics-pd",display="cite")` and `r tbls("demographics-dbs",display="cite")`.
All participants were native or near-native-like speakers of North American English and had self-reported adequate vision or corrected vision for reading print. 
<!-- Controls reported no history of neurological disease, and PD participants reported no history of neurological disease prior to their PD diagnosis. -->
<!-- had no self-reported history of any neurological disorders (other than PD and dysarthria for the clinical groups)[^1007],  -->
All but the YC participants underwent a 40 dB SPL hearing screening at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz unless they wore hearing aids. All YC participants self-reported normal hearing. All OC, PD-Med, and PD-DBS participants completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Participants were not, however, excluded on the basis of hearing or cognitive status. Two OC, four PD-Med, and two PD-DBS participants reported wearing dentures.
<!-- Results of these screenings are reported in `r tbls("demographics-pd",display="cite")` and `r tbls("demographics-dbs",display="cite")` below. -->

<!-- [^555]:Two PD participants reported they spoke Dutch as a native language and had English as young children after moving to Canada (PD-A10, PD-A20), but reported growing up speaking North American English and were thus included in the final study. One participant reported speaking Spanish at home as a child (PD-A01) but received all schooling in English in Ontario and reported English as his dominant language. One participant grew up speaking English in Trinidad and reported moving to Ontario in his twenties (PD-A16).  -->

<!-- [^1007]: **XX find a better way to report this:** Exceptions to this included reports of childhood stuttering, which two PD-Med  participants reported had reemerged with PD (PD-Med 01, PD-Med 03). One PD-DBS participant reported having had seen a speech-language pathologist as a child but could not recall the reason. Two participants reported having had a transient ischemic attacks that did not result in speech disturbances several years prior (PD-Med 01 and PD-DBS14). Two control participants reported no history of speech, language, or neurological disorders, but presented with mild articulatory abnormalities (OC06 and OC10). Given they were both aware of these and did not attribute them to any disease or incident, data from these participants was retained. One participant reported having received spinal cord stimulation approximately six months prior (PD-Med 15). Two OC, four PD-Med , and two PD-DBS participants reported wearing dentures. -->

<!-- YC participants were speech-language pathology or audiology graduate students recruited from Western University in London, Ontario. -->
<!-- OC participants were recruited from the community. -->
<!-- Parkinson's participants from both groups were recruited through the Movement Disorders Centre at University Hospital in London, Ontario.  -->
Participants in the two PD cohorts were deemed eligible if they had 1) received a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease at least one year prior, 2) were stabilized on anti-parkinsonian medication and/or via surgical STN-DBS settings. PD-Med participants were also recruited on the basis of evidence of at least mild dysarthria, as identified by a neurologist on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) present in their patient chart history. PD-DBS participants were not recruited on the basis of speech symptoms, and represented a convenience sample of STN-DBS patients. Deviant perceptual characteristics listed in `r tbls("demographics-pd",display="cite")` and `r tbls("demographics-dbs",display="cite")` below were determined by consensus by the first two authors (TK, SA). 

<!-- [^926]: Two DBS participants reported they did not wear dentures but were planning to be fit for them. -->
<!-- Characteristics were noted according to the recommended dimensions used by the Mayo Clinic dysarthria studies [@duffy2019], which were adapted from the original features described by Darley, Aronson, and Brown (1969a; 1969b; 1975). Note that these features were not determined during a standardized passage reading, as is often recommended [@duffy2013]; this was due to time restrictions during the study. Speech intelligibility listed in the table is included as an index of speech severity. Speech intelligibility was collected from recordings of six randomly selected sentences from the Sentence Intelligibility Test [@yorkston1996sit] elicited during the habitual speech condition. These sentences were scaled and presented at 70 dB and rated via a visual analog scale by six female graduate students in speech-language pathology as part of a larger study. -->

<!-- All data collection took place in the Speech Movement Disorders Laboratory at Elborn College at Western University (London, ON).  -->
<!-- The clinical cohorts elected the time of day that they wished to come in to complete the study. In most cases, this coincided with their optimal 'on' state relative to their PD medications and self-reported fatigue. In some cases, participants were required to take their medication during the protocol and were permitted a break to do so[^a]. The total time for data collection (including consent and additional data collection factors) was approximately two to three hours. -->

### Audio recording procedure

Recordings were made in an audiometric booth (Industrial Acoustic Company) using a 2017 15-inch Dell laptop computer (Inspiron 15). Participants wore a headset microphone (AkG c520), positioned 6 cm from the mouth, and connected to the laptop via a preamplifier and digitizing unit (M-Audio MobilePre) attached via USB. The headset was positioned so as to allow hearing aids and glasses to remain in place. Experimental audio recordings were made via a customized MatLab script [@matlab], which digitized the audio signals at 44.1 kHz and 16 bits. Practice trials (described below) were recorded separately in Praat [@praat].

#### Speech tasks

The primary speech tasks of interest included 1) sentences read aloud and 2) extemporaneous monologue[^1108].
A unique randomized list of six sentences was created for each participant and trial. Each list included words ranging from five to ten words in length (one sentence at each length) from the Sentence Intelligibility Test (SIT) item bank [@yorkston1996sit]. Sentences were split into two short lists (5, 7, 9 words and 6, 8, 10 words) during task administration.
Participants also engaged in approximately two minutes of extemporaneous monologues in which they were prompted to talk about specific topics (e.g., favorite vacations).

[^1108]: Two other tasks were included in the complete protocol as part of a larger project; these included 1) nonce words in a carrier phrase and 2) picture description. Tasks were designed to represent a continuum of linguistic complexity. Only sentences and monologue production are reported here. 

#### Speech rate conditions {#rate-conditions}

Seven speech rate conditions were elicited: habitual rate, three slower rates, and three faster rates. Participants performed each speech task once for each of the conditions. The habitual rate was always elicited first. Fast rates and slow rates were elicited in blocks that increased or decreased respectively in the magnitude of the elicited modified rate. Modified rate blocks were counterbalanced across participants. Modified rates were elicited using magnitude production (i.e., rather than a more rigid method such as metronome pacing) in an effort to elicit more natural speech [@tjaden2004; @adams1993; @turner1995]. 
For each condition, the following instructions were given: "For this next part, please speak at a rate that feels [2x/3x/4x] [*slower*/*faster*] than your normal speaking rate."
In addition to verbal instructions, participants had constant access to a visual prompt as well.

Prior to beginning a new rate condition, participants were provided with an opportunity to practice the new rate with a probe sentence. This practice session was recorded and used to ensure they were indeed speaking more slowly or rapidly than the previous condition. They were encouraged to read the sentence aloud at least two or three times, but also as many times as they needed to feel comfortable and accurate at the new rate. While the absolute rate was not important, they were encouraged to at least be sure they felt faster or slower than the previous rate (depending on the block). One of their practice sentences was then played back to them and then played again approximately every ten trials in order to assist them in maintaining their target rate.

#### Speech task randomization {#speech-randomization}

Within each of the seven speech rate conditions, the four speech tasks were presented in a quasi-randomized order. The monologue task was always presented last, while the order of all other speech tasks were randomized. This was done in order to ensure that participants were maximally adjusted to the given target speaking rate by the time they were asked to engage in spontaneous speech, in order to minimize the cognitive load of this task.
Breaks were offered as needed.
<!-- For each trial, text appeared on the screen. In the reading tasks (nonsense words, sentence reading), participants were encouraged to read the text silently before they began speaking aloud. In the spontaneous speech tasks (picture description, monologue), instructions appeared on the screen, at which point the investigator would present the appropriate prompt. In all cases, the text on the computer screen would turn red to indicate that they could begin speaking. The investigator controlled the timing of when to advance to the next stimulus. Breaks were offered as needed. -->

<!-- At the end of all three rate blocks, participants performed one last task, in which they were prompted to read aloud a sentence as fast as they possibly could. The sentence for this task was the prompt sampled in each rate condition ("She saw Pattie buy two poppies"). Participants were permitted to read the sentence as many times as they wanted in order to reach their maximum rate. Upon reaching their maximum rate, the investigator prompted them to go even faster three more times in order to ensure that their maximum rate was truly obtained.  -->

<!-- A subset of the speakers also repeated portions of the 2x-faster and 2x-slower conditions at the end for reliability purposes, though this task was eventually discarded for time reasons. -->

<!-- An example of the task schedule within a rate condition could be as follows: -->

<!-- > Picture 1, Nonce List 1, Pattie prompt, Nonce List 2, Sentences List 1, Picture 2, Picture 3, Nonce List 3, Sentences List 2, Nonce List 4, Conversation. -->


## Intelligibility experiment
### Listener participants

Listeners were six female second year speech-language pathology graduate students recruited from Western University graduate speech-language pathology second-year class. 
<!-- Eight of the listeners participated in the Nonce Word task, and the remaining six participated in the Connected Speech task.  -->
All were under the age of 35. All received clinical speech hours for their participation in the study.
Listeners passed a hearing screening at 20 dB SPL HL for octave frequencies from 250 to 8000 Hz. The listening task was performed in a sound attenuated booth with audio stimuli presented via a pair of external speakers calibrated to 70 dB SPL (SPL-A; slow setting). All listeners completed the intelligibility tasks over the course of approximately four weeks, during which they came in for approximately four to five self-paced sessions, most lasting approximately two-hours each (approximately 10 hours in total).
<!-- Actually 20dB but one listener failed in one ear -->
<!-- **XXDiscuss why SLP students were chosen; see "agreement study" of angie's thesis for brief description of more experienced listeners and baselines for ICC calculations** -->
<!-- {#listening-tasks} -->

### Intelligibility procedures and tasks

#### Stimuli preparation

Sentences and monologue passages were extracted and rescaled to 70 dB SPL. Read sentences were extracted at the utterance boundaries. From the monologue recordings, 10 to 20 seconds of continuous, spontaneous speech samples from each participant in each condition were extracted. In some cases, e.g., if 10 to 20 seconds of uninterrupted speech were not possible (e.g., because of long pauses or requests for more information), one to three subsets of speech were identified and concatenated together until 10 - 20 seconds of speech were obtained.

##### Listening task

Utterances were presented in five playlists: four playlists for the sentences comprised of four to five speakers from each group, and one playlist containing the monologue samples from all speakers. Playlists were presented in a different random order for each listener, and utterances within each playlist were randomized each time.

Listeners rated the sentences and monologues along a computerized visual analog scale (VAS). All listeners heard all stimuli from all speakers (49 items in total per speaker participant: 7 items x 7 rates)[^437]. Ten percent of items were repeated for reliability purposes, amounting to 3,665 total utterances. The VAS tasks were administered via a customized Praat script written by the first author that featured a horizontal line with anchors "Low intelligibility" and "High intelligibility." Listeners were instructed to rate the intelligibility of each utterance by clicking the point along the scale corresponding to their rating. Listeners were not permitted repeat trials.

[^437]: Three PD participants had incomplete data sets. One PD-Med participant (PD-Med 09) experienced dyskinesias that interfered with some of the audio recordings in the fast block, and two PD-DBS participants elected not to complete all rate conditions due to fatigue (PD-DBS 02 and 04). Specifically, PD-DBS 02 did not complete the fastest condition, and PD-DBS 04 did not complete the slowest condition and the two fastest conditions. 
<!-- [^705]: A complete set would have included 3,665 utterances: six sentences plus one monologue sample each produced by 68 speakers at seven rates, plus 10% repeats. -->

##### Inter- and intra-rater reliability {#vas-reliability-methods}

Reliability of the speech intelligibility estimation task was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC; @koo2016]. Inter-rater reliability across the six listeners was examined using average consistency in a two-way random model (ICC 2, k) for each of the two tasks (sentences, monologue). Intra-rater reliability for each listener and task was examined using average agreement in a two-way mixed model (ICC 3, k).


<!-- [^1147]: The first two listeners were presented with more utterances for reliability purposes (20% instead of 10%). Given the length of the task, it was later decided that only 10% would be presented to listeners. -->

<!-- [^1139]: Linear mixed effects regression was used in all cases except for non-convergence or singular fits. In such instances, an ANOVA was used instead. When calculating intra-rater reliability, non-convergence occurred for Listeners 4 (sentences and monologue) and 6 (sentences), and a singular fit was observed for Listener 1 (monologue). -->

## Outcome measures and statistical analyses

Intelligibility ratings were treated as a proportion of the VAS (0 to 1, low to high), which was logit-transformed and modelled as a function of speaker group, speech rate, and utterance complexity using mixed effects regression with the lmerTest package [@lmerTest] in R [@r]. Utterance complexity included comparisons for each sentence length (5 - 10 words) and task (sentences vs. monologue).
Random effects included by-participant random intercepts and random slopes for rate, as well as nested by-item random intercepts.
Random slope terms were uncorrelated in order to facilitate convergence and avoid over-parameterization of the models [@tanner2017; @stuartsmith2015].
 The $p$-values were calculated using the Satterthwaite approximation from the `lmerTest` package [@lmertest].

All categorical fixed effects terms were contrast coded in a manner that made theoretical sense for the levels being compared, as described below.
***Speaker group*** was coded as a four-way level variable and coded using reverse Helmert contrasts. Helmert contrasts allow the mean of each level to be compared to the overall mean of the subsequent levels.
The contrast scheme for group may be interpreted in the following way: 1) Young versus Old (YC vs. OC, PD, and DBS groups combined); 2) Healthy Older vs. Clinical (OC vs. PD and DBS combined); 3) PD with and without DBS (PD vs. DBS). 
***Speech rate*** was coded using treatment contrasts with the habitual rate (H1) set as the reference level. That is, each contrast level compares one of the six modified rate conditions to the habitual baseline. Comparisons between each modified rate were discerned with post-hoc pairwise comparison testing.
Speaker sex and listener were also included as fixed effects in the models to account for variability present. 
<!-- In addition, participants that were considered to be inclusion criteria edge-cases were flagged (i.e., those described above as having dentures, childhood speech impairments, a language other than English spoken during childhood, and speech distortions noted in the two controls). A second model was run and compared to the first in order to discern whether the inclusion of these participants affected the results. -->

To confirm whether the speech rate conditions were indeed associated with speech rate modifications in the expected directions, a secondary analysis was run.
Speech rate was log-transformed and modelled as a function of rate condition, group, and their interaction. Groups were coded using Helmert contrasts as above. Successive differences contrasts were applied to rate conditions using the `MASS` R package [@mass] in order to test the difference in speech rate between each condition in a sequential, ordered fashion. With this coding scheme and the rate variable ordered from slow to fast, each contrast level may be interpreted as the difference between the means of subsequent levels, for example, the 3x-slower and 4x-slower rates, the 2x-slower and 3x-slower rates, the habitual and 2x-slower rates, and so on.
<!-- Pairwise comparisons within each group were computed using the `emmeans` R package [@emmeans]. -->

<!-- From manual: The contrast coefficients are chosen so that the coded coefficients in a one-way layout are the differences between the means of the second and first levels, the third and second levels, and so on. This makes most sense for ordered factors, but does not assume that the levels are equally spaced. -->

Habitual speech rates for the sentence condition are presented in `r tbls("tab-habit",display="cite")`. Pairwise comparisons across groups during the habitual rate condition are presented in `r tbls("tab-habit-wpm",display="cite")`.
Across all rates, there was no main effect of group for any of the group contrasts, indicating that the groups demonstrated similar rates of speech during sentence reading ($p$ > 0.5).
There were no baseline differences in speech rate during the habitual rate condition, as indicated in `r tbls("tab-habit-wpm",display="cite")`.

Pairwise comparisons across sequential rates for each group are reported in Appendix Table 1. Full model results (i.e., pooled over groups) are reported in the text. Speech rate in words-per-minute varied as expected across the rate conditions, with each rate contrast level associated with an increase in speech rate. This was significant for all contrast levels with the exception of the two fastest rates, whose difference trended in the expected direction but did not reach significance at $p$ < 0.05
($\hat{\beta}$ = `r sits_durB['rate_orderedF4-F3']`, $p$ `r report_p(sits_durP['rate_orderedF4-F3'])`). This relationship is evident in `r figs("plot-wpm",display="cite")`.
As can be seen in `r figs("plot-wpm",display="cite")` Panel A, there was a greater degree of variability in the slower rates of speech, as evidenced by flatter density curves.
This pattern is visible in `r figs("plot-wpm",display="cite")` (Panel B).
Estimated differences across sequential rates for each group, reported in Appendix Table 1, demonstrated that this pattern of rate adjustments was generally consistent across all rates for all groups, despite not reaching significance at all rate comparisons.

<!-- As described in the methods (Section \@ref(vas-reliability-methods)), listener reliability for the speech intelligibility estimation tasks were computed using the intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC; @koo2016]. Separate coefficients were computed for each task. Inter-rater reliability was calculated as the average consistency in a two-way random model (ICC 2, k), and intra-rater reliability was calculated using average agreement in a two-way mixed model (ICC 3, k). -->
Average inter-rater reliability for the sentence task was
`r sits_inter[1,2]` (95% CI: `r sits_inter[1,7]` - `r sits_inter[1,8]`), 
and 
`r conv_inter[1,2]` (95% CI: `r conv_inter[1,7]` - `r conv_inter[1,8]`)
for the monologue task. 
This can be interpreted as *good* and *excellent* inter-rater reliability, respectively [@koo2016].

Average intra-rater reliability for the sentence task was *good*
(mean: `r round(sits_intra_mean,3)`, range: `r round(sits_intra_min,3)` - `r round(sits_intra_max,)`)
and *excellent* for the monologue task
(mean: `r round(conv_intra_mean,3)`, range: `r round(conv_intra_min,3)` - `r round(conv_intra_max,3)`)
[@koo2016]. Intra-rater reliability scores for each listener and task are presented in 
`r tbls("tab-sits-intra",display="cite")` and `r tbls("tab-conv-intra",display="cite")`.

<!-- [^357]: The higher degrees of freedom for Listeners 1 and 2 in tbls("tab-sits-intra",display="cite") reflect that they were presented with 20% instead of 10% of files for reliability purposes. The amount repeated was later reduced to minimize the task time. -->

```

<!-- Given that 13 participants were noted as having histories or presentations that may affect intelligibility[^313], a second, otherwise identical model was run to test whether the exclusion of these participants had an effect on the overall model results.

<!-- ($\chi^2$ = `r round(aov_vas["m_vas_problematic","Chisq"],3)`, -->
<!-- $p$ `r report_p(aov_vas["m_vas_problematic","Pr(>Chisq)"])`). -->
<!-- All participants were thus included in the analyses. -->

<!-- [^313]: As mentioned in the Methods **(XX)**, this included those with dentures (OC203, OC206, OC211, PD310, PD241, PD320, PD322, DBS506), English as a second language (PD301, PD310, PD316, PD320), re-emergent stuttering (PD301, PD303), suspected transient ischemic attack (PD301), and the two controls with mildly perceptible distorted speech (206, 210). -->

<!-- Three PD participants had incomplete data sets. One PD-Med participant (PD-Med 09) experienced dyskinesias that interfered with the audio recordings in the fast conditions (XX), and two PD-DBS participants elected not to complete all rate conditions due to fatigue (PD-DBS 02 and 04). Specifically, PD-B02 did not complete the fastest condition, and PD-B04 did not complete the slowest condition and the two fastest conditions. -->


### Main effects
Main effects, i.e., effects when other variables are held constant, are reported first. Interactions are reported in the following sections. 

#### Speaker group

All three group contrasts were significant and may be interpreted in the following way: the YC group was rated as most intelligible
(YC vs. OC, PD, DBS:
$\hat{\beta}$ =  `r vasB['groupYC vs rest']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['groupYC vs rest'])`),
followed by the OC group
(OC vs. PD, DBS:
$\hat{\beta}$ =  `r vasB['groupOC vs rest']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['groupOC vs rest'])`),
with the DBS group being rated as least intelligible
(PD vs. DBS:
$\hat{\beta}$ =  `r vasB['groupPD vs DBS']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['groupPD vs DBS'])`).


#### Speech rate
When averaged across all speaker groups, all three fast rates were associated with increasing declines in speech intelligibility, as captured by significant effects of each rate compared to habitual speech, and increasingly larger estimates
(F2: $\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['rateF2vH1']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['rateF2vH1'])`;
F3: $\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['rateF3vH1']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['rateF3vH1'])`;
F3: $\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['rateF4vH1']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['rateF4vH1'])`)[^1100].
In contrast, none of the slowest rates were associated with significant changes in intelligibility when averaged over speaker groups.

[^1100]: Sentences from 2 participants (OC 08 and PD-DBS 12) were not included in the final playlist in error, but were included in the monologue task.

<!-- . only the slowest rate was associated with a significant change in intelligibility compared to habitual speech  -->
<!-- (S4: $\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['rateS4vH1']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['rateS4vH1'])`). In this case, the slowest speech condition was associated with worse intelligibility compared to habitual speech. -->
<!-- The S2 condition ("speak 2x-slower than your normal rate of speech") demonstrated a non-significant trend towards increased intelligibility  -->
<!-- (S2: $\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['rateS2vH1']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['rateS2vH1'])`), and the S3 condition was not significantly different -->
<!-- (S3: $\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['rateS3vH1']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['rateS3vH1'])`). -->

#### Task
The monologue task was associated with significantly lower speech intelligibility compared to the sentences
(Task: $\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['taskSentvSpont']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['taskSentvSpont'])`).
<!-- Across the read sentence lengths, the 9-word sentences were overall rated as less intelligible compared to the shorter (5 - 8) word sentences  -->
<!-- ($\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['complexity5-8v9']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['complexity5-8v9'])`), -->
<!-- but no other comparisons across sentence rates were significant. -->
<!-- **(XX this is kind of confusing because sentence length really should be continuous)** -->

### Group by rate interactions

Given the contrast coding, two-way interactions between speech rate condition and group reported in this section may be interpreted as follows. A significant interaction for a given rate (i.e., 2x/3x/4x-slower or faster) and a given group contrast (i.e., YC vs. rest, OC vs. Clinical, PD vs. DBS) indicates that at that rate, the magnitude and/or direction of change in intelligibility compared to habitual speech differed for the groups at that contrast level. 
The model predictions in `r figs("plot-rg",display="cite")` A demonstrate the observed interaction patterns. Empirical data are shown in `r figs("plot-rg",display="cite")` B.

#### Slow speech
In this model, a significant positive estimate at a given rate indicates that, compared to habitual, the intelligibility difference was *more positive* for the reference group in a given contrast, whereas a negative estimate indicates the difference was *smaller* or *more negative* for the reference group.

As can be seen in `r figs("plot-rg",display="cite")` A, the YC, OC, and PD-Med groups do not demonstrate any changes in speech intelligibility at the slower rates of speech, whereas the PD-DBS group shows a sharp increase at the 2x-slower rate before leveling off. In the model, this difference was reflected in the significant group x rate interaction for the PD-Med vs. PD-DBS contrast in the 2x-slower rate condition
($\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['groupPD vs DBS:rateS2vH1']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['groupPD vs DBS:rateS2vH1'])`). 
There were no other significant interactions between group and rate for the 2x-slower condition, indicating that intelligibility for all groups were rated similarly at this rate compared to their habitual speech ($p$ > 0.1).

At the 3x-slower rate, a significant negative interaction for the OC vs. PD contrast suggested the OC groups showed less change (compared to habitual speech) than the PD groups combined
(OC vs. PD, DBS: $\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['groupOC vs rest:rateS3vH1']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['groupOC vs rest:rateS3vH1'])`). 
<!-- The negative contrast implies that the the OC group did not see as much positive change in intelligibility from habitual speech to the 3x-slower speech compared to the clinical groups. -->
This finding was mainly driven by the finding that the PD-DBS group demonstrated steeper intelligibility gains in the 3x-slower condition compared to habitual speech, as shown by the significant group by rate interaction for the PD-Med versus PD-DBS contrast
(PD vs. DBS: $\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['groupPD vs DBS:rateS3vH1']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['groupPD vs DBS:rateS3vH1'])`).

At the slowest rate (4x-slower), interactions for the YC vs. Rest and OC vs. Clinical contrasts showed that the control groups showed relative decreases in intelligibility compared to baseline, while the PD groups combined showed relative increases
(YC vs. Rest: $\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['groupYC vs rest:rateS4vH1']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['groupYC vs rest:rateS4vH1'])`;
OC vs PD, DBS: $\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['groupOC vs rest:rateS4vH1']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['groupOC vs rest:rateS4vH1'])`).
Once again, this was driven by the PD-DBS group. 
As can be seen in `r figs("plot-rg",display="cite")` A, in the 4x-slower condition (S4), intelligibility for the PD-DBS group drops, bringing it closer to the lower intelligibility ratings observed in habitual speech. Meanwhile, intelligibility ratings for the PD-Med group remain essentially stable across all slow rates. It is this drop, then, for the PD-DBS group at the slowest rate, that explains the lack of an interaction for the PD-Med vs. PD-DBS groups for this comparison.

<!-- As can be seen in `r figs("plot-rg",display="cite")`, intelligibility rises only slightly for the PD group at 2x-slower, and then tapers off. Conversely, for the DBS group, a steeper, linear rise in speech intelligibility continues for the first two slow conditions before dropping off at the slowest rate (4x-slower). -->

#### Faster speech
As with slow speech, for fast speech, a negative estimate implies that the reference group showed a *more negative* change in intelligibility compared to at habitual rates.
`r figs("plot-rg",display="cite")` shows that, in general, all groups showed relative declines in fast speech.

At all three faster rates, significant negative interactions were found for the PD-Med vs. PD-DBS contrast, indicating that the PD-Med group saw a greater decline in intelligibility at this rate compared to the PD-DBS talkers
(PD vs. DBS, 2x-faster: $\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['groupPD vs DBS:rateF2vH1']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['groupPD vs DBS:rateF2vH1'])`;
3x-faster: $\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['groupPD vs DBS:rateF3vH1']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['groupPD vs DBS:rateF3vH1'])`;
$\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['groupPD vs DBS:rateF4vH1']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['groupPD vs DBS:rateF4vH1'])`). 

No significant interactions were found for the OC vs. PD contrast at the faster speech rates, indicating that the older healthy controls demonstrated an overall similar direction and magnitude of intelligibility declines in faster speech compared to the combined PD groups.
A significant negative interaction for the YC vs. Rest comparison at the fastest rate (4x-faster) suggests that the younger healthy controls actually saw a greater *relative magnitude* of change in intelligibility at the fastest rates compared to the OC group
(YC vs. Rest, 4x-faster: $\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['groupYC vs rest:rateF4vH1']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['groupYC vs rest:rateF4vH1'])`).

#### Group by task interactions
Results are displayed in `r figs("fig-rgt-loess",display="cite")`.
A significant interaction was found for the YC vs. Rest comparison, which indicated that, across all rates, task differences in intelligibility for the YC group were smaller than for the other three groups combined
(YC vs. Rest, Task: $\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['groupYC vs rest:taskSentvSpont']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['groupYC vs rest:taskSentvSpont'])`).
Neither of the other group comparisons reached significance, though the PD-Med vs. PD-DBS comparison demonstrated a non-significant trend suggesting that while the PD-Med speakers were overall rated as more intelligible than the PD-DBS speakers, this difference widened in the monologue task
($\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['groupPD vs DBS:taskSentvSpont']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['groupPD vs DBS:taskSentvSpont'])`).

For the most part, there were few significant three-way group, rate, and task interactions at both the slower and faster rates, suggesting that groups demonstrated similar patterns of intelligibility across the rate continuum in each of the tasks. 
At slower rates, an exception to this was the three-way interaction for the PD vs. DBS contrast at the 2x-slower rate
($\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['groupPD vs DBS:rateS2vH1:taskSentvSpont']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['groupPD vs DBS:rateS2vH1:taskSentvSpont'])`). 
This suggests that the PD-DBS group (compared to the PD-Med group) showed a larger intelligibility benefit at the 2x-slower rate in the monologue task compared to the sentence reading task. This pattern is visible in the empirical plots displayed in
`r figs("fig-rgt-loess",display="cite")`, in which the PD-DBS talkers show a steep spike in monologue speech intelligibility at S2 compared to H1, and compared to sentence intelligibility. The PD-Med talkers, on the other hand, show a much more modest increase in monologue speech intelligibility.


At faster rates, a non-significant negative interaction between the OC vs. PD and DBS groups at the 2x-faster rate, suggesting that the intelligibility difference between older healthy and disordered speaker groups widened in monologue speech.  Specifically, `r figs("plot-rg",display="cite")` suggests a complex group pattern at this rate, whereby the OC group remained stable, the PD-Med group declined, and the PD-DBS group actually showed a modest increase in intelligibility.

The fastest rate (4x-faster) was associated with a three-way interaction with group and task for both comparisons involving the control speakers 
($\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['groupYC vs rest:rateF4vH1:taskSentvSpont']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['groupYC vs rest:rateF4vH1:taskSentvSpont'])`;
$\hat{\beta}$ = `r vasB['groupOC vs rest:rateF4vH1:taskSentvSpont']`, $p$ `r report_p(vasP['groupOC vs rest:rateF4vH1:taskSentvSpont'])`).
Similar to the pattern observed in the two-way interaction, this suggests that the difference in intelligibility ratings between healthy and disordered speakers widened in monologue speech, and in this case that the difference was observed to be even greater at the fastest speech rates. `r figs("plot-rg",display="cite")` demonstrates that monologue speech intelligibility does not change for either control group to the extent that it did for the PD groups.
There were no significant three-way interactions for the PD group comparison at any of the fast rates.

A series of pairwise comparisons was run to test for differences within groups and tasks for each sequential rate (H1 vs S2, S2 vs S3, S4 vs S4, etc.). These are reported in Appendix Tables 2 and 3.
<!-- tbls("emm-sit",display="cite") and tbls("emm-mon",display="cite"). -->
<!-- To do this, a simplified model was run in which the Complexity variable, which included levels for each sentence length as well as a comparison across tasks, was replaced with a Task variable, which averaged across the sentence lengths for the Sentence task.  -->
Post-hoc pairwise comparisons were computed using estimated marginal means (i.e., least-squares means) from the `emmeans` package, with $p$-values adjusted using the Tukey method [@emmeans]. The estimates are equal to the estimated difference between pairs. Differences were computed as the contrast on the left minus the contrast on the right. 
In Appendix Tables 2 and 3,
<!-- tbls("emm-sit",display="cite") and tbls("emm-mon",display="cite"),  -->
the *estimate* reported for the *contrast* H1-S2, then, reflects estimated intelligibility in the habitual condition minus intelligibility ratings in the 2x-slower (S2) condition.
A negative estimate, for example between habitual speech and 2x-slower (written as H1-S2), would indicate that the habitual rate (H1) had a lower intelligibility rating than the 2x-slower rate (S2) for a given group. 
A positive difference, on the other hand, for example between habitual speech and 4x-faster (written as H1-F4), would indicate higher intelligibility for habitual speech compared to the 4x-faster condition for a given group. 

Only comparisons to habitual rate (e.g., S4 vs. H1) and sequential comparisons (e.g., S4 vs. S3, S3 vs. S2) are reported here. Comparisons spanning more than one rate adjustment were not of interest (e.g., S4 vs. S2 or S4 vs. F3). Comparisons were considered significant at $p$ < 0.05.

Slower rates, compared to habitual speech, did not yield any significant pairwise comparisons for any group in either task with two exceptions for the PD-DBS group. Compared to habitual speech, the S3 condition (3x-slower) was associated with significantly higher sentence intelligibility
(estimated difference = `r emm_taskB['H1S3_DBS_Sentence',1]`, $p$ `r report_p(emm_taskP['H1S3_DBS_Sentence',1])`),
and the S2 condition (2x-slower) demonstrated a non-significant trend towards higher monologue intelligibility
(estimated difference = `r emm_taskB['H1S2_DBS_Spontaneous',1]`, $p$ `r report_p(emm_taskP['H1S2_DBS_Spontaneous',1])`).

Faster rates, compared to habitual speech, were associated with significant declines in intelligibility for most comparisons in the Sentence task.
The 2x-faster rate condition (F2) was associated with declines in sentence intelligibility for the PD-Med group
(estimated difference = `r emm_taskB['H1F2_PD_Sentence',1]`, $p$ `r report_p(emm_taskP['H1F2_PD_Sentence',1])`).
The faster rates, F3 and F4, were associated with declines in sentence intelligibility for both control groups and the PD-Med group
(H1-F3: 
YC: estimated difference = `r emm_taskB['H1F3_YC_Sentence',1]`, $p$ `r report_p(emm_taskP['H1F3_YC_Sentence',1])`;
OC: estimated difference = `r emm_taskB['H1F3_OC_Sentence',1]`, $p$ `r report_p(emm_taskP['H1F3_OC_Sentence',1])`
PD-Med: estimated difference = `r emm_taskB['H1F3_PD_Sentence',1]`, $p$ `r report_p(emm_taskP['H1F3_PD_Sentence',1])`;
H1-F4:
YC: estimated difference = `r emm_taskB['H1F4_YC_Sentence',1]`, $p$ `r report_p(emm_taskP['H1F4_YC_Sentence',1])`
OC: estimated difference = `r emm_taskB['H1F4_OC_Sentence',1]`, $p$ `r report_p(emm_taskP['H1F4_OC_Sentence',1])`,
PD-Med: estimated difference = `r emm_taskB['H1F4_PD_Sentence',1]`, $p$ `r report_p(emm_taskP['H1F4_PD_Sentence',1])`).

These 3x and 4x-faster rates (but not the 2x-faster rate) were also associated with declines in monologue speech intelligibility for the PD-Med group
(H1-F3: estimated difference = $\hat{\beta}$ = `r emm_taskB['H1F3_PD_Spontaneous',1]`, $p$ `r report_p(emm_taskP['H1F3_PD_Spontaneous',1])`;
H1-F4: estimated difference = $\hat{\beta}$ = `r emm_taskB['H1F4_PD_Spontaneous',1]`, $p$ `r report_p(emm_taskP['H1F4_PD_Spontaneous',1])`).
Faster rates were not associated with significant changes in sponmonologuetaneous speech intelligibility for any of the other groups.

Sequential differences across rates (e.g., 2x vs. 3x and 3x vs. 4x-slower or faster) were not associated with significant changes for any pairwise comparisons at $p$ < 0.05.

# Discussion

The current study aimed to quantify changes in speech intelligibility across a wide range of self-selected speech rates for individuals with and without PD. The three primary goals of this study included 1) characterizing intelligibility patterns at three slower and three faster rates compared to habitual rates of speech, 2) quantifying differences between older and younger healthy controls as well as people with PD with and without STN-DBS, and 3) quantifying differences between sentence reading and monologues.

## Group differences across speech rates
### Changes in speech rate
Few studies have examined more than two rate manipulation conditions in dysarthria [@tjaden2000coartic; @tjaden2003], and none of these multi-rate studies explored changes in intelligibility. 
Evidence from multi-rate studies in healthy talkers suggests that individuals do not modify their speaking rate in a linear fashion [@adams1993; @tsao2006]. 
Rather, healthy speakers tend to make smaller adjustments on the faster end of the rate continuum, and larger adjustments on the slower end, resulting in a quadratic or more complex non-linear relationship between intended and actual speech rate [@adams1993].
This pattern was supported by the finding of greater magnitudes of change (larger absolute estimated differences) in speech rate in slower conditions compared to the faster conditions, displayed in Appendix Table 1.
<!-- tbls("tab-pairwise-wpm",display="cite").  -->
For example, the YC slowed their speech rate by an estimated 89 WPM from habitual to the 2x-slower condition (S2 - H1), but only quickened their rate by an estimated 48 WPM in the 2x-faster condition (H1 - F2). 
This pattern held for the older control group and both PD groups as well.
Changes in absolute WPM from habitual in the 2x-slower and 2x-faster rates, respectively, for each group were as follows: 59 WPM vs. 25 WPM (OC), 52 WPM vs. 37 WPM (PD-Med), and 42 WPM vs. 22 WPM (PD-DBS).

### Changes in intelligibility
In general, for most talkers, slow speech was not associated with gains in intelligibility. This was the case for both the younger and older healthy controls as well as the PD-Med group. The PD-DBS group, however, did see gains in the slow speech conditions, and these gains were magnified in the monologue compared to the sentence readings.
Slow speech did not, at any point along the continuum, demonstrate a clear intelligibility benefit for the PD-Med group, a finding that supports recent literature suggesting that slow speech is often associated with minimal or no gains in speech intelligibility for people with PD [@fletcher2017predicting; @kuo2014; @mcauliffe2017; @vannuffelen2009; @vannuffelen2010; @tjaden2004]. To the authors' knowledge, talkers with DBS have not previously been included in studies of speech rate manipulation, likely because of the heterogeneity in speech symptoms and changes following STN-DBS surgeries [@aldridge2016] that pose a challenge when controlling for experimental variables. Findings in the present study emphasize that their inclusion in future studies of behavioral modification is warranted and suggest they may stand to benefit from such strategies in ways that differ from talkers with PD undergoing standard pharmaceutical treatment.

Lower speech intelligibility was found for the monologue task compared to the sentence reading task, and group differences were greater in the monologue task. These findings are consistent with previous accounts of extemporaneous speech being rated as less intelligible than more structured speech tasks such as reading for people with PD [@yorkston1981; @weismer1984; @kempler2002; @kent1996], but differs from others that have found no differences in intelligibility ratings between monologue and paragraph reading [@bunton2008; @tjaden2011intelligibility].

The PD-DBS group also demonstrated lower overall intelligibility in general, especially at their habitual rates of speech. This difference was widened in the monologue task, which was associated with lower intelligibility for both PD groups. This pattern is visible in `r figs("plot-rgt",display="cite")`.
These findings support previous accounts of higher intelligibility scores for structured speech tasks for talkers with PD [@yorkston1981; @weismer1984; @kempler2002; @kent1996; @bunton2008; @tjaden2011intelligibility]. Mounting evidence suggests that STN-DBS is associated with worsening of speech symptoms in PD [@aldridge2016; @iulianella2008; @krack2003; @skodda2012], a trend also supported by the present study. 

Previous research has suggested that gains in intelligibility that result from global behavioral strategies including slow speech can be predicted from baseline speech features [@fletcher2017predicting]. Specifically, talkers with PD with more severe speech impairment and greater temporal variation in their speech may show greater benefits in slow speech [@fletcher2017predicting]. The PD-DBS group in the present study was not selected for their speech characteristics, but their lower baseline intelligibility is consistent with this possibility. More work is warranted to determine whether severity and other baseline speech characteristics are predictive of intelligibility gains in individual speakers.

## Rate continuum
### Slow speech
An aim of the present study was to explore changes in intelligibility across a rate continuum. As can be seen in the left panel of `r figs("plot-rgt-loess",display="cite")`, the PD-Med speakers showed a modest (non-significant) trend for increased intelligibility at the 2x-slower rate, but slowing down further did not yield additional benefit. In fact, intelligibility began to decrease again in the 4x-slower rate condition. This pattern also held for the control speakers, though, given that controls were rated as highly intelligible to begin with, this effect was very small. 
This pattern is consistent with what @yorkston1999 theorized when predicting the likely trade-off between speech intelligibility and naturalness. 
The PD-DBS talkers, however, saw a continued rise in intelligibility.
Notably, for the PD-DBS talkers, improvements were most evident at the 3x-slower rate (in sentence reading) and the 2x-slower rate (in spontaneous speech). This is consistent with two previous studies that incorporated multiple slow rate targets, demonstrating that having speakers slow to 60% of their habitual rate of speech offered greater gains in sentence intelligibility compared to slowing to 80% [@yorkston1990; @hammen1994].
This pattern was more prominent in the monologues compared to sentence-reading, as exhibited in `r figs("plot-rgt-loess",display="cite")`. This difference was likely also driven by the PD-DBS group, who showed markedly lower habitual speech intelligibility in the monologue task compared to in sentence reading. This baseline difference between speech tasks is supported by previous literature that shows more structured speech tasks are often associated with higher intelligibility ratings for talkers with PD [@bunton2008; @kempler2002; @kent1996; @tjaden2011intelligibility; @yorkston1981]. This finding also highlights the importance of including spontaneous speech tasks when assessing changes in intelligibility resulting from behavioral speech modifications. 

### Fast speech
In contrast to slower speech, faster speech was generally associated with predictable decreases in intelligibility for all groups. This patterns with previous research that have elicited faster rates of speech for talkers with PD [@kuo2014]. 
The PD-Med group showed steeper declines compared to the PD-DBS group in both tasks. That is, there was an asymmetric effect of rate modification for the PD-Med group, whereby they saw little change in intelligibility at slower rates, and substantially worse intelligibility at faster rates. The PD-DBS group, on the other hand, saw similar magnitudes of change for the sentence task (i.e., the effect of rate on intelligibility was more linear for the PD-DBS group), and actually saw non-significant *increases* in intelligibility at faster rates in the monologue task.
This pattern has been observed in talkers with PD once before.
@kuo2014 showed that not *all* speakers demonstrated declines in speech intelligibility at faster rates. The trend for intelligibility to rise for the PD-DBS group lends more support to this observation [@kuo2014; @mcrae2002; @weismer2000]. It is not yet clear why the PD-DBS talkers not only did not get more difficult to understand at faster rates but, at least in some cases, became more understandable.
Anecdotally, some participants were observed to increase their effort and loudness during the fast speech tasks. Acoustic analyses related to the observations are ongoing and needed in order to draw conclusions surrounding the underlying bases of intelligibility changes across the speech rate continuum.



<!-- Move to discussion  -->

<!-- The relationship between speech rate and intelligibility showed a clear non-linear pattern, with faster rates of speech associated with greater magnitudes of change. Groups differed in their The relationship between speech rate and intelligibility is likely nonlinear, though the precise relationship is difficult to speculate without the inclusion of a wider range of rate conditions. @vannuffelen2010 found that while improvements in intelligibility were observed in approximately half of their subjects following rate reduction, the maximal rate reduction was not necessarily associated with maximal intelligibility. @yorkston1999 suggested a trade-off between speech intelligibility and rate, such that at both very slow and very fast rates intelligibility suffers, while intelligibility gains can be identified somewhere in between. This curvilinear relationship may differ across individuals. -->

In summary, these findings suggest that the relationship between speech rate, speech task, and intelligibility is complex and varied. Talkers with PD and STN-DBS were more likely to benefit from rate reduction compared to talkers with PD without STN-DBS, and less likely to deteriorate when increasing their speech rate.
A deeper exploration into the acoustic changes associated with speech rate modifications and their potential impact on intelligibility are necessary to understand the speech changes responsible for the perceptual differences.
